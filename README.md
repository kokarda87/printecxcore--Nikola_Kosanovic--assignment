# printecxcore-{Nikola_Kosanovic}-assignment

In this project, I have made accordingly to the task a small app that handles paying via QR Code od Utility Template. I  was using MVC Core and .Net 6, and mini.css for a little bit of styling. 

In the code I have left a certain amount of comments where I explained what I have done, and also used Culture Info where I set culture to en-US because of the data format that is comming from qr code. 

The app is working in this way: it tries to handle a payment by calling an API eithier from QR Code that is uploaded to app and then read, either from a utility form. If everything is ok, the app will call an JokeAPI, and if not a screen with an error will come up.
